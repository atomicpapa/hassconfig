Above are the various configuration files for my Home Assistant (HASS) setup. Currently, HASS is running in Docker on a Dell i7 desktop computer with 16G of RAM, a 1TB internal HDD and a 10TB Western Digital external HDD. It's running Ubuntu Server 18.04 LTS.<br>
<br>

## Docker:

- Home Assistant
- Mosquitto MQTT Broker
- Portainer
- Glances
- Esp Home
- Gosense
- InfluxBD
- Grafana
- Watchtower
- Motioneye
- MagicMirror2

and 18+ additional containers including Minecraft, Plex Media Server and others.<br>
<br>

## Hardware:

- 5 IP cameras (cheap, chinese clones)
- 2 Google Homes
- 3 Google Home Minis
- Phillips Hue Hub
- DIY ESP8266 RF <-> MQTT Bridge running Tasmota
- 1 Kerui Motion Sensor
- 10+ RF Door/Window Contact Sensors
- Ring Doorbell
- Honeywell WiFi Thermostat
- 2 Samsung Galaxy Tab 4 8.0 (SM-T330NU) Tablets as User Interfaces
- 1 Tuya color light bulb
- 1 Wyze Cam v2
- 1 Wyze Motion Sensor
- 1 Wyze Door/Window Sensor (not sure where the other one disappeared to, but I did find the magnet!)
- several Teckin SP10 and SP20 (Power Monitoring) Switches

## Additions coming quickly will include:

- WiFi controlled RGB LED strip lights inside and outside
- New security cams to replace the older 640x480 chinese clones
- More Wyze sensors
